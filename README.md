# ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) Rejection Algorithm
> Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is is used to estimate posterior distributions of the model
parameters.
> ABC is a computational method rooted in Bayesian inference. 
In Bayesian inference, likelihood is a crucial component.

> For simple models, an analytical formula for likelihood can be derived.
But, in most cases, the likelihood functions of the observations are unknown or intractable analytically.
> In such cases, likelihood-free methods such as ABC become very useful in estimating the posterior
distribution of model parameters. 

> ABC bypasses the evaluation of likelihood function and computed
posterior distributions. In this way ABC can be applied to wide variety of complex models to estimate
parameters.
